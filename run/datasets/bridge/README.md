#### Overview
This dataset provides simulated sensor data for bridge health monitoring with a focus on estimating live load on a bridge deck using both displacement and acceleration signals. The data was generated using the Train-Track Bridge (TTB) simulator [1], a Matlab-based Finite Element Method tool that realistically models the interactions among trains, tracks, and bridges under varying load and temperature conditions. The dataset includes temperature as an exogenous variable, which has a strong influence on both displacement and acceleration signals, notably causing shifts in the displacement signal's magnitude and acceleration signal's frequency.

#### Statistics:
490,398 samples
756 unique conditions under different load and temperature conditions
21 features (10 displacement + 10 acceleration + 1 exogenous variable (temperature))
