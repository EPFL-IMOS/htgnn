#### Overview
This dataset is developed to estimate bearing loads under various operating conditions (rotational speed, axial and radial loads) using data from temperature and vibration sensors. These sensor modalities provide complementary information: vibration signals indicate the magnitude of the load, while temperature measurements reveal the spatial distribution of the load within the bearing.  The dataset emulates a real-world deployment scenario of a virtual sensor, mirroring scenarios where a physical sensor's operational life is limited, such as when a sensor roller collecting field data experiences premature battery depletion. It contains 55 unique operating conditions, defined by axial load (Fx), radial load (Fy), and rotational speed.
